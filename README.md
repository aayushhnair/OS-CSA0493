Operating System for File System CSA0493 Practical programs

1.	Create a new process by invoking the appropriate system call. Get the process identifier of the currently running process and its respective parent using system calls and display the same using a C program.
2. Identify the system calls to copy the content of one file to another and illustrate the same using a C program.
3. Design a CPU scheduling program with C using First Come First Served technique with the following considerations. 
a. All processes are activated at time 0. 
b. Assume that no process waits on I/O devices.
4. Construct a scheduling program with C that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next.
5. Construct a scheduling program with C that selects the waiting process with the highest priority to execute next.
6. Construct a C program to implement pre-emptive priority scheduling algorithm.
7. Construct a C program to implement non-preemptive SJF algorithm.
8. Construct a C program to simulate Round Robin scheduling algorithm with C.
