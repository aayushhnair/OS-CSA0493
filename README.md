Operating System for File System CSA0493 Practical programs

1.	Create a new process by invoking the appropriate system call. Get the process identifier of the currently running process and its respective parent using system calls and display the same using a C program.
2. Identify the system calls to copy the content of one file to another and illustrate the same using a C program.
3. Design a CPU scheduling program with C using First Come First Served technique with the following considerations. 
a. All processes are activated at time 0. 
b. Assume that no process waits on I/O devices.
4. Construct a scheduling program with C that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next.
5. Construct a scheduling program with C that selects the waiting process with the highest priority to execute next.
6. Construct a C program to implement pre-emptive priority scheduling algorithm.
7. Construct a C program to implement non-preemptive SJF algorithm.
8. Construct a C program to simulate Round Robin scheduling algorithm with C.
9. Illustrate the concept of inter-process communication using shared memory with a C program.  
10. Illustrate the concept of inter-process communication using message queue with a C program.  
11. Illustrate the concept of multithreading using a C program.
12. Design a C program to simulate the concept of Dining-Philosophers problem
13. Construct a C program for implementation the various memory allocation strategies.
14. Construct a C program to organize the file using single level directory.
15. Design a C program to organize the file using two level directory structure.
16. Develop a C program for implementing random access file for processing the employee details.
